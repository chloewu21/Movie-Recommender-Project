# Movie Finder
## Introduction
With so many movies to choose from, it has become harder to find one that suits your personal taste. Movie Finder is a movie recommendation system that uses Python to produce accurate recommendations based on a film's genre, release year, and rating. Three different types of recommendation systems (content-based, collaborative, and demographic) that are commonly used by companies like Netflix and Amazon to recommend products and services were incorporated.
